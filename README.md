The app uses the openweathermap to fetch the weather forecast at the device location.

The design is greatly inspired by Google's weather app.

Things that can be improved:
- Add every strings to string resources
- Error handling (Network, HTTP, etc)
- Add a default screen with a search feature in case the user did not allow the app to use the GPS
